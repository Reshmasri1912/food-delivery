                Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of South Asia. 
                It is made with Indian spices, vegetables, rice, and usually some type of 
                meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, or fish), or in some cases without 
                any meat,[1] and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes.[2]
                Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among 
                the diaspora from the region. Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts
                 of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia

            <p>Pizza is an Italian food that was created in Italy (The Naples area). 
                It is made with different toppings. Some of the most common toppings 
                are cheese, sausages, pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes, spices and herbs
                 and basil. These toppings are added over a piece of bread covered with sauce.
                  The sauce is most often tomato-based, but butter-based sauces are used, too.
                   The piece of bread is usually called a "pizza crust". Almost any kind of 
                   topping can be put over a pizza. The toppings used are different in different 
                   parts of the world. Pizza comes from Italy from Neapolitan cuisine. However, 
                   it has become popular in many parts of the world.[1]
